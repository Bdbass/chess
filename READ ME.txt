Game of chess in C++, best if played in terminal. First demo, not fully working. 

Things to fix: 
1. Show a-h at the bottom and numbers on the side of the board 
1. Pawns can take a piece in front of themselves, shouldn't be able to 
1. Pawn can always move forward 2 spaces, should only be able to do once
1. Pawn should only be allowed to move sideways/diagonally if an opposing piece is there
2. check if either player lost a king 
3. show what piece a player lost 
4. Include knighting 
5. Include get new piece if a pawn gets to the other side 
6. Add an undo method
